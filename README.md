# ham-stuff

Open-source tools and utilities for amateur radio operators who like to tinker.

## About

I'm hybotix - an electronics tinkerer, robot builder, and ham radio enthusiast. I create practical solutions for problems that frustrate me, then share them openly so others can benefit. My brain works differently: I visualize complete systems, build them, and ship them. No bureaucracy, just working code.

## Projects

### ðŸ”§ [flrig-bridge](./flrig-bridge/)

**Complete rig control solution for Xiegu G90 (and other radios)**

Solves the critical Hamlib G90 transmit bug by routing control through FlRig. Provides:
- Fast GQRX panadapter bridge with bidirectional sync
- Universal rigctld server for any Hamlib-compatible software
- Multi-radio configuration support
- Bulletproof Python startup scripts
- Comprehensive error handling

**Status:** âœ… Complete, tested, production-ready

**Perfect for:** G90 owners wanting SDR panadapter, multi-radio station automation, anyone frustrated with Hamlib bugs

### ðŸ“¡ [dxcc-scraper](./dxcc-scraper/)

**DXCC data scraper and search tool**

Utility for working with DXCC (Deleted X-Ray Country Code) data.

**Status:** ðŸš§ Active development

## Philosophy

**I build things the "right" way, not just the "fast enough" way.**

- Clean, readable code
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed documentation
- No external dependencies when possible
- Built to last, not just to work

## Support This Work

Living on disability since 2000, but my mind never stops. I create these tools freely, but parts, tools, and learning resources cost money I don't always have.

If my projects help you, please consider sponsoring:

**GitHub Sponsors:** (Pending approval - coming soon!)

Your support directly enables more open-source ham radio and maker tools.
